# Node.js Learning Topics

This repository contains code and notes for the following Node.js topics, with practical examples and in-depth explanations:

---

## What is Node.js?
- Introduction to Node.js, its architecture, and use cases.
- Explanation of the event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
- When and why to use Node.js for server-side development.

---

## User Defined Modules
- How to create and export your own modules using CommonJS (`module.exports`) and ES Modules (`export`/`import`).
- Examples of splitting code into reusable files.
- Best practices for organizing and structuring Node.js projects.

---

## Built-in Modules
- Usage and examples of core Node.js modules such as:
  - `fs` (File System): Reading and writing files asynchronously and synchronously.
  - `path`: Handling and transforming file paths.
  - `os`: Accessing operating system information.
  - `events`: Creating and using custom event emitters.
  - `crypto`: Performing cryptographic operations (e.g., hashing, encryption).
  - `http`: Building HTTP servers and clients.
  - `cluster`: Scaling applications across CPU cores.

---

## Internals of Node.js
- Deep dive into the Node.js event loop and its phases.
- Explanation of libuv and how Node.js handles asynchronous operations.
- Microtask queues (`process.nextTick`, Promises) vs. macrotask queues (timers, I/O, etc.).
- Thread pool and how Node.js manages CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks.
- Worker threads and cluster module for parallelism and scaling.
- Diagrams and code samples illustrating event loop behavior and timing anomalies.

---

## npm (Node Package Manager)
- Installing, updating, and removing packages.
- Understanding `package.json` and managing dependencies.
- Using npm scripts to automate tasks.
- Publishing your own packages to the npm registry.

---

## CLI Tool Development
- Building command-line tools with Node.js.
- Parsing command-line arguments.
- Using packages like `commander` or `yargs` for robust CLI interfaces.
- Creating executable scripts and adding them to your npm package.

---

## Miscellaneous Topics
- Error handling and debugging techniques in Node.js.
- Environment variables and configuration management.
- Using `process` and `os` modules for system-level operations.
- Performance tips and best practices for scalable Node.js applications.
- Comparison of concurrency models: Worker Threads, Cluster, and Thread Pool.

Each topic includes hands-on code examples and explanations to help you understand and apply Node.js concepts in real-world projects.
